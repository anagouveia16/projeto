    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>We were intended to select an existing product and design an online shop that sells it, creating a Design System.
        We could only use one font and 4 colors; we also had to keep in mind all of the accessibility requirements in order to create the design system.</p>
    
    <h3>Duration</h3>
    <p>5 weeks</p>

    <p>One of the challenges of this project was to have only 4 colors on the Design System.
        The font selected for this project was Armin Grotesk due to its visual it matches the product aesthetics and tone of voice.
        We could only use 7 fonts sizes and the icons are from Google Material Design.We also had to keep in mind all of the accessibility requirements in orderto create the design system.</p>

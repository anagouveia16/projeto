        <h2>The Challenge</h2>
        <p>We were intended to select an existing product and design an online shop that sells it, creating a Design
            System.
            We could only use one font and 4 colors; we also had to keep in mind all of the accessibility requirements
            in order to create the design system.</p>

    <h2>Duration</h2>
    <p>5 weeks</p>

    <h2>The process</h2>
    <p>The process of this project was very back and forth as it was very important to iterate along the design and keep in mind the requirements of accessibility. My concept to create the online shop was to "invent" and sell the first eco-friendly speaker assistant.</p>
    <p>One of the challenges of this project was to have only 4 colors on the Design System. The font selected for this project was Armin Grotesk due to its visual, it matches the product aesthetics and tone of voice. We could only use 7 fonts sizes and the icons I used are from Google Material Design. We also had to keep inmind all of the accessibility requirements in order to create the design system.</p>
    <p>The forms and the buttons have a height of 54px to comply the accessibility requirements of sizing in mobile.</p>

    <h2>Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I understood how rigorous and organized we need to be in order to create a balanced/harmonious Design
            System, consistency is key;</li>
        <li>Gained visual knowledge from developing an online shop, creating a hierarchy from the most important action
            to the least;</li>
        <li>Thought and iterate a lot to comprehend the more useful and intuitive flows the user can have in the app
            without getting lost.</li>
    </ul>

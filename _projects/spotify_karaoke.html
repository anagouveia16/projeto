    <h1>Spotify Karaoke Feature</h1>
    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>Our goal was to design a new feature on an already existing global app, so we chose Spotify. It was intended for our featureto be intricate enough, while still sticking to the existing brand design system.</p>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>The new karaoke feature will allow users to read the lyrics and sing their favorite songs in solo, battle or duet mode, via desktop or mobile.</p>

    <h2>Project Details</h2>
    <p>Group project (100% remote)</p>
    <p>4 weeks to develop.</p>

    <p>Our work process consisted on four main phases: research, analysis, ideation and prototyping.</p>
    <p>During research we did some benchmark in order to analyse the exisiting competitor apps and games that would be related to karaoke. We also created a survey to recieve some answers so we could understand the viability of our solution and in order to understand the existing design system of Spotify, we did some research of the app's UI. </p>
    <p>Overall, in the analysis phase we thought about the content that we needed to choose to integrate our feature, a lot of brainstormings, how might we's were made and to help us understand our users needs we also created Customer Journey Maps and Personas.</p>
    <p>We ended up creating 7 user flows due to the dynamic handling that is possible to make and then we started sketching, design mockups and then prototype. In the end, to validate our prototye we also did some usability testing.</p>

    <h4>Takeaways</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>This was my first group project where I had a feeling of leadership. I helped guiding my colleagues through the whole process and organized how we should work;</li>
        <li>I understood more deeply which design methods should be applied during the process in order to fulfill the user’s needs;</li>
        <li>It is really important to iterate a lot to understand the best user flow the app can have to facilitate the user experience in an intuitive and simple way.</li>
    </ul>

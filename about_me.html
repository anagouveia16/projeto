 <section>

     <p>My “story” with product design didn’t start in a smooth way. I started my design journey when I was in my senior year where I was responsible for the student’s union communication department. There I fell in love with the possibilites that graphic design could lead me to create. I got a bachelor in graphic design and during those three years I always thought that digital design was a big no for me and that I loved editorial design. During this, I ran away big time from digital interfaces and user-centered methods. After my intership extremely focused on what I was looking for that time, editorial design and somewhat illustration, I had a project that was mainly about designing digital products and that was when I realized that I really wanted to understand how to design for users and which solutions were the best.</p>
            
     <p>Currently I am a designer interested in end-to-end projects and in developing innovative digital experiences    through human-centered design and my working process includes research and project strategy, information architecture, user flows, wireframing, testing, and iterating.</p>
